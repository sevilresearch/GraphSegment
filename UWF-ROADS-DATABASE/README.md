# UWF-ROADS-DATABASE
UAV images of roads on the UWF campus post hurricane Sally.  The masks were created by me for the purpose of road extraction.

## Overview
These images come from a larger database that I have helped repurpose for unsupervised image segmentation.

### > Images
There are two image types: 

1. High resolution - Pictures taken by UAV.
2. Low resolution - Screenshots from UAV video.

### > Masks
The masks can be interpreted as follows:

The green pixels represents <b>non-road</b> regions with high certainity.  The black pixels represent <b>road</b> regions with high certainty.  The red pixels represents the border between <b>non-road</b> and <b>road</b> and regions that are hard to classify.
